      <p>Hello! My name is Chad Haley. I am a self-taught web developer focusing on front end. I was born and raised in the DFW area of Texas. I currently reside in downtown Forth Worth with my girlfriend Stephanie and our 2 dogs Brennus (historical name.. ask me! Rome was almost conquered before it became the great historical civilization we know of) and Jake the dog. Some of my hobbies include mountain biking, discovering new craft brews and going to Rangers baseball games.</p>
      <p>I graduated from the University of North Texas with a bachelors in history. One of my biggest takeaways from this is the ability to critical think. I have worked in the pharmaceutical manufacturing industry for many years. At the end of 2019 I decided my life needed some drastic change with my current career path and to get out of pharmaceuticals. Web development and coding have long been an interest of mine so I decided to take a leap of faith and dive right into this field. I have long awaited to do something I am completely passionate about and I look forward to this continual adventure of creation and design!</p>
